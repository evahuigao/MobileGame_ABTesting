Cookie cat is a mobile game developed by Tactile Entertainment. The company wants to determine whether the gate should be placed at gate 30 or gate 40. How will the different choices affect the retention rates of new users? AB-test was applied to answer this question, given a dataset consisting of five variables and around 1 million observations.
